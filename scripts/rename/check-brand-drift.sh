# The brand-drift guard (#794, extended by #887): no NEW old-brand identifier
# enters this tree.
#
# Issue #794 renamed the runtime identifiers this project inherited from its
# two previous names -- rclone-manager's `RM_` environment variables and
# backup-manager's `bm_` cookies -- to `BACKUPD_` / `backupd_`. That rename
# is a one-off edit; this file is the part that makes it stay done. Without
# it the next `RM_SOMETHING` somebody adds by copying a neighbouring line
# is invisible until the third rename, which is how this repository got two
# brands' worth of prefixes in the first place.
#
# EPIC R (#885) is that third rename: `backupd` becomes `retnd`. Issue #887
# points this guard at the name the epic retires, and the four patterns #794
# left behind stay exactly as they were -- `RM_DEBUG` is still a kept alias
# and the twenty-three `RM_*` token-and-path pairs are still another
# repository's environment contract, so replacing them would trade one blind
# spot for another (FR-40).
#
# WHAT IT LOOKS FOR: the creation of an identifier carrying an old brand
# name, in any tracked source file. Eleven patterns, in two families.
#
# The four from #794, case-sensitive and anchored on their left:
#
#   RM_[A-Z]     rclone-manager environment variables
#   BM_[A-Z]     backup-manager environment variables (none exist today)
#   bm_[a-z]     backup-manager cookies, container and helper names
#   rbm_[a-z]    the never-used third variant, blocked before it exists
#
# The seven FR-40 adds. The first three are anchored on their RIGHT as well,
# and that anchor is the whole design of this extension:
#
#   backupd[^a-z]          the lowercase spelling: backupd_session,
#                          backupd.yml, /var/lib/backupd
#   BACKUPD_[A-Z]          the environment prefix
#   Backupd[^a-z]          the display spelling: Backupd, BackupdError
#   backupdproject         the organisation, so a new absolute link to it
#                          goes red (FR-41 moves the coordinates)
#   RCLONE_MANAGER_[A-Z]   the FIRST brand's spelled-out environment prefix,
#                          which no #794 pattern matched and which has
#                          therefore been green for two renames
#   rclone[-_ ]manager     the first brand, case-insensitively: still live as
#                          `RCLONE-MANAGER-BACKUP-COMPLETE` sentinels and as
#                          prose
#   backup[-_ ]manager     the second brand, case-insensitively: still live
#                          as `BACKUP_MANAGER_*` variables and as prose
#
# WHY THE RIGHT-HAND ANCHOR. `backup` is this product's domain word, so a
# case-insensitive `backupd` would be a guard nobody keeps: it flags 50
# occurrences of nine real identifiers -- BackupDetailPage,
# BackupDefaultsPage, BackupDomainPolicy, BackupDetail,
# TestBackupDataAreSeparateMounts, TestBackupDataOnEveryClaimedPlatform,
# BackupDomain, TestBackupDoesNotReturnWhileAWorkerIsStillReading,
# TestBackupDoesNotLeaveItRunningForever -- none of which is the product's
# name. `BackupDetailPage` is green here because the `D` is followed by a
# lowercase `e`; `backupd_session` is red because `_` is not a lowercase
# letter. BackupSet (7,774 occurrences), backup-set (1,989), BACKUP_DIR (40)
# and backup_status (12) are untouched by all three patterns, and
# scripts/rename/selftest.sh plants every one of those names in a green case,
# because "the guard is green" and "the guard matches nothing" are otherwise
# the same observation.
#
# Each pattern is anchored on a non-identifier character to its left too, so
# `CONFIRM_DELETE` is not an `RM_` variable and rclone's `ibm_signer.go` is
# not a `bm_` cookie. `rbm_` needs a pattern of its own for exactly that
# reason: the `r` in front of it is an identifier character, so the `bm_`
# pattern cannot see it.
#
# WHAT IT ALLOWS: three lists, and they mean three different things.
#
#   ALIASES     the deprecated aliases a rename deliberately KEEPS for one
#               release so an upgrade does not break. Allowed anywhere in
#               the tree, because an alias has to be minted, read, tested
#               and documented, and pinning it to a file list would turn
#               every one of those into a gate failure.
#   PENDING     identifiers that are still on `main` and are being deleted
#               by a rename in flight, with no alias. Allowed anywhere, and
#               expected to disappear: when one does, this script says so
#               and the entry should be deleted.
#   PREEXISTING old-brand identifiers that are out of the rename's scope,
#               pinned as token+path pairs. Pinning the path is the point:
#               the occurrences that exist stay green, and the same name
#               appearing in a new file is a creation and goes red.
#
# The lists are consulted most-specific first: a token+path pair on
# PREEXISTING wins over a bare token on ALIASES or PENDING. That ordering is
# what lets both lists be true at once during a rename in flight -- `backupd`
# is on PENDING because 1,433 files are still to be swept, and the same token
# is pinned to the dated design records that will never be swept, so those
# pins are already load-bearing rather than becoming so on the day PENDING
# empties.
#
# A list entry that matches nothing left in the tree is reported and does
# NOT fail the run: a rename lands by deleting occurrences, and a guard that
# goes red the moment the thing it guards is fixed is a guard nobody keeps.
# Deleting the reported line is the fix. EPIC R depends on this directly:
# #887 lands the guard with every surviving occurrence on PENDING, and each
# later issue deletes its own entries as it sweeps them (FR-40).
#
# Shell and `git grep`, deliberately, where most of scripts/ is Python
# now (EPIC I, #672): the whole check is one pattern sweep over tracked
# files plus three fixed lists, it has to run in the pre-commit path, and
# `git grep` is the one tool that already knows what "tracked source" means.
#
# TWO SWEEPS AND ONE PASS. `git grep -o` prints every match with its file and
# line, so the classification below reads a single stream rather than
# re-scanning each hit line: on this tree the `backupd` family alone matches
# around eight thousand times, and a `grep`-plus-`sed` pipeline per hit line
# (which is what this did when the four #794 patterns matched two hundred)
# would spend minutes forking. There are two sweeps rather than one because
# the case rules differ per family and `git grep` has no per-alternative case
# flag: `-i` on the first four patterns would make `rm_` an `RM_` variable and
# `BackupDetailPage` a `Backupd` identifier, while the two earlier brands are
# genuinely live in `BACKUP_MANAGER_WEB_TEST_VAR` and `RCLONE-MANAGER-BACKUP-
# COMPLETE` as well as in lowercase prose.
#
# Registered in scripts/ci-local.sh (the gate .husky/pre-commit runs) and in
# .github/workflows/ci.yml. scripts/rename/selftest.sh is the proof it can
# still go red; scripts/ci-local.sh runs that too.
#
# Exit code contract, which is all a gate step needs:
#
#   0        every occurrence found is on a list
#   1        at least one is not, and the run printed file, line and name
#
# NOTE: the repository root comes from `git rev-parse --show-toplevel` of
# the CURRENT WORKING DIRECTORY, the same as the scripts/architecture
# checks, which is what lets the self-test point this at a throwaway tree.

# The kept deprecated aliases. Exactly the identifiers a rename keeps working
# for one release, and nothing else. Each one is primary nowhere: the
# preferred name is BACKUPD_DEBUG / backupd_session / backupd_csrf, and these
# stay only so an in-place upgrade keeps reading the operator's existing
# environment and keeps existing browser sessions valid.
#
# EPIC R adds none yet, on purpose. FR-37's shims (`backupd_session` /
# `backupd_csrf` read-compat, the duplicated `backupd_*` gauges, the
# `BACKUPD_*` hook variables, the `/backupd-web` entrypoint) are minted by
# R1.4 and R1.5, and each arrives here with its closing issue and its removal
# release (FR-43) in the issue that mints it. Until then those names are
# occurrences being deleted, which is PENDING, not shims being kept.
#
# When the deprecation window closes, the alias and its line here go
# together, and this script reports the line as unused the moment the alias
# is gone.

# Out of scope, pinned to the files they already live in.
#
# Four groups, and none of them is a rename's to fix:
#
#   * The RM_* names are the ENVIRONMENT CONTRACT of another repository.
#     scripts/bdtools/e2e/run_tests_repo_gate.py and
#     scripts/e2e/three-machine-web-ui.sh set them for the suites in
#     backupdproject/backupd-tests, pinned at scripts/e2e/tests-repo.pin;
#     that repository reads them by these names. Renaming them here alone
#     breaks the e2e gate, so it is a two-repository change with a pin bump
#     in the middle. EPIC R does that sweep in R2.5 (#895), in lockstep with
#     the tests repository, at which point these lines move to `pending` and
#     then go; parking them for a fourth rename is what FR-40 refuses.
#   * bm_stopped and bm_routed are helper METHOD names in the two-machine
#     backup proof (scripts/bdtools/e2e/two_machine_backup.py): "run the
#     CLI on the stopped machine" and "...through the routed one". They are
#     internal to that file and rename cleanly, but they are not a runtime
#     identifier anybody upgrades across, so they belong to whoever next
#     touches that proof.
#   * The dated design records under docs/design/. A design note is the
#     record of a decision at the moment it was taken and is deliberately not
#     kept in step with later work (docs/epic-checklist.md §5), so renaming
#     one falsifies it -- and each HTML mockup has a PNG export beside it
#     that no text edit can follow. `Backup Manager.dc.html` is the oldest of
#     them and carries the second brand in its own filename; FR-40 names it
#     specifically as not-renamed.
#   * EPIC R's own three documents. The spec, the inventory and the
#     conformance matrix are an account OF the old name: they enumerate the
#     tokens being deleted, and docs/EPIC-R-rename-backupd-to-retnd.md §4
#     writes down the three names the self-test plants (`backupd_newthing`,
#     `BACKUPD_NEW_THING`, `BackupdWidget`), which exist nowhere else in the
#     tree and must stay red everywhere else. Pinned rather than pending
#     because a rename does not delete its own record.
#
# .github/workflows/rclone-upgrade-gate.yml is a fifth, one-file group: every
# occurrence in it is a `backupdproject/backupd#N` reference to an issue filed
# under the old coordinates. GitHub's transfer preserves `#N` and redirects
# the URL, and rewriting a record of where work was tracked falsifies it.
#
# scripts/ci-local.sh is a sixth: its gate-step prose names the prefixes the
# step looks for (`RCLONE_MANAGER_`, `BACKUP_MANAGER_`), exactly as this
# file's own header does, and this file is excluded by path for that reason.
# Pinned as the bare prefix rather than excluded by path, so a real
# `RCLONE_MANAGER_SOMETHING` added to the gate script is still a creation.
#
# Two more groups are handled by path exclusion below rather than by a pin,
# because they are machine-written or wholly historical and pinning them
# would mean editing this list on every release: CHANGELOG.md, which is the
# account of all three renames, and provenance/**, whose released-artifact
# records name published binaries and are regenerated forward, never
# rewritten. rclone's own `ibm_signer.go`, which FR-40 also lists here, needs
# no entry at all: the left-hand anchor already makes it green, and
# selftest.sh keeps a case proving that.
#
# Every line is <token> <path>, one occurrence-site per line. Adding one of
# these names to a file that is not listed is a creation, and this guard
# treats it as one.
