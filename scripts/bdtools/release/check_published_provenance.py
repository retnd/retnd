"""Refuse a change to a published release's provenance record.

Issue #895 (R2.5), row R2.8 of `docs/conformance/epic-r-matrix.md`, and
FR-43's line about `provenance/**`:

    provenance/** records RELEASED artifacts and is append-only history;
    it is regenerated forward, never rewritten.

That sentence had no check behind it. `distribution/cmd/provenance`
regenerates the bundle and `TestComplianceArtifactsMatchThisTree` holds
the checked-in bytes to what this tree generates, which is the opposite
question: it asserts the record tracks the tree, and says nothing about
whether a fact about an artifact that has already been pushed to a
registry has been quietly restated. This is that check, and EPIC R is
why it is needed now rather than later: FR-41 moves the image reference
and re-issues the signing identity, and the honest way to do that is to
ADD a record for the releases published after the cutover, not to edit
0.4.0's to say it was published from an organisation that did not exist
when it shipped.

# WHAT IS IMMUTABLE, AND WHAT IS DELIBERATELY NOT

Most of `provenance/release-provenance.json` is a DERIVATION over the
current tree: the digests of `NOTICE`, the licence inventory, the SBOM
and the checksum manifest all move whenever a distributed artifact
changes, and they are supposed to. Measured over this file's own
history rather than assumed: `checksums.sha256` changed in 23 of the
commits that touched it, and `license.notice.sha256` in 10, while
`semanticVersion` stayed 0.4.0 and `published` stayed true throughout.
A guard that froze those fields would refuse every provider-artifact
edit in EPIC R's own Phase 2, which is how a guard gets deleted.

What cannot move is the record of what was PUSHED. A registry digest is
the identity a `cosign verify` pins and the thing an operator's compose
file resolves; restating it makes this project's compliance record
describe an artifact nobody can fetch. So four fields are frozen for a
version whose record says `published`:

    releaseManifest.published              true never becomes false
    releaseManifest.recordedBuildVersion   what the shipped binaries answer
    releaseManifest.architectures          what was built
    releaseManifest.registryDigests        what was pushed, per architecture

`imageReference` and `signing.identity` are NOT frozen, and that is a
decision rather than an omission: FR-41 re-issues the identity and moves
the registry path, and the documented `verify` command presents the old
identity for releases published before the cutover and the new one for
those after (FR-41's own words). Freezing them here would refuse the
cutover this epic is for. What keeps them honest is
`TestThePublishGateAgreesWithTheSigningIdentity` and
`TestOnlyTheReleaseRefCanPublish` in `distribution/packaging`, which is
where the identity's correctness already lives.

# WHY THE BASELINE IS `main` AND NOT THE FIRST RECORD EVER

0.4.0's registry digests were recorded three times before the release
was really out -- `b5825f60` recorded them, `aa752b0c` re-recorded after
a digest-recording commit re-triggered a publish, and `44d92fc7`
recorded the real final pair. Anchoring on the FIRST record of a version
would therefore report those three corrections, which were pre-release
fixes to a record of something that had not finished being published,
as rewrites. So the baseline is the merge base with `origin/main`: the
claim this enforces is FORWARD -- nothing that lands from here changes a
published fact -- which is exactly what "regenerated forward, never
rewritten" says.

# EXIT CODES

    0   no published fact moved (or this is a new release, or there is
        no baseline to compare against, which is stated rather than
        assumed)
    1   a published fact moved, and the run named the field, the value
        on the baseline and the value now
    2   the tool could not do its job: a bundle that will not parse, or
        a git invocation that failed

Run standalone:

    bash scripts/release/check-published-provenance.sh

Wired into `scripts/ci-local.sh` beside the other provenance guards and
into `.github/workflows/ci.yml`.
`scripts/bdtools/tests/published_provenance_guards.py` is the proof it
can still go red, and it plants both refusals.
