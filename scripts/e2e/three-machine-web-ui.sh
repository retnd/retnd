# HELP-START
# Three machines on private networks, a real deployment, and a browser that
# has to talk to it over the wire.
#
# # The blind spot this closes
#
# suites/web-ui over in backupdproject/backupd-tests starts `npm run dev`
# and the app it drives resolves createMockApi out of
# ui/shared/src/api/mock.ts. So every case in that suite is a claim about a
# component rendering correctly GIVEN a fixture, and not one of them can go
# red on anything in the path a user actually meets:
#
#     browser -> serve-ui -> reverse proxy -> serve -> SQLite
#
# That is not a theoretical gap. The Activity page errored in the browser on
# a real NAS while the server answered HTTP 200 with valid JSON in twenty
# milliseconds, and it went unnoticed, because nothing that watches the
# server can see it and nothing that mocks the client can either: a mock
# answers with the shape the client already expects. This script stands up
# the whole path so a browser can fail on it.
#
# # The three machines
#
#   CLIENT    the browser and the Playwright runner, both inside the
#             container (scripts/e2e/client-machine.Dockerfile). It is on
#             the edge network and nothing else, so the only thing it can
#             reach is the product's front door.
#
#   RCLONE-MANAGER  the real product image, built from THIS working tree,
#             running the deployment container/compose.yaml describes.
#
#   VPS       a real sshd holding real files (atmoz/sftp, through
#             scripts/e2e/source-machine.Dockerfile, the same definition
#             two-machine-backup.sh and core/tests/machines use), playing
#             the machine being backed up.
#
# Three machines, four containers, and the difference is worth being plain
# about. The product IS two containers: `/backupd-web serve` (the engine: local
# authentication, /api/v1, the scheduler, SQLite) and `/backupd-web serve-ui`
# (the static bundle plus a reverse proxy to the engine). Collapsing them
# into one would delete the reverse-proxy hop, and that hop is half of what
# this suite exists to cover. So "the backupd machine" here is the
# product's own split, unchanged.
#
# # Why this drops docker-in-docker, and what that gives up
#
# scripts/e2e/two-machine-backup.sh runs its manager machine as
# docker-in-docker and installs onto it with the real installer. That is
# the right shape for what it proves, and its own comment says why this one
# cannot borrow it: the dind daemon is a network namespace of its own, so
# 8080 in there is not 8080 out here, and a sibling client container has no
# route to it at all. The two ways out were to publish the inner port back
# out of the dind container onto the shared network, or to drop dind and
# run the product image directly on the network. This takes the second.
#
# Publishing back out would work, and what it would produce is a browser
# talking to a port forwarded by a daemon running inside a daemon, which is
# a hop that exists nowhere in production. Every timeout and every reset on
# it would be a question about the test rig. The thing under test here is
# an HTTP path, so the fewer inventions between the browser and the server
# the better.
#
# What that gives up is stated rather than quietly dropped: THIS SCRIPT
# DOES NOT TEST THE INSTALLER. It tests the running product.
# two-machine-backup.sh remains the test that scripts/install/
# install_docker_host.py takes a bare machine to a working deployment, and
# it must stay that way. A green run here says nothing about whether an
# operator can install this.
#
# # Three networks, not one
#
#     client ──edge── web-ui ──internal── engine ──backhaul── vps
#
# One flat network would have been fewer lines. It would also let a spec
# reach the engine directly and pass while proving nothing about the proxy,
# and it would put the client on the same wire as an engine that runs with
# TRUST_FORWARDED_HEADERS=true, which container/compose.yaml goes to some
# length to explain is only safe because serve-ui is its sole possible
# peer. Both of those are the topology doing work, so the topology is the
# real one. Nothing is published to the host on any of them.
#
# The name `backupd` lives on the edge network only, and it resolves
# to the UI container: from outside the deployment that IS backupd,
# and it is the address the browser is given. Inside the deployment the
# containers keep compose's own names. One name per network, so nothing
# ever resolves to two things.
#
# # Seeded state, generated per run, committed never
#
# The VPS holds three files of known content. The deployment is configured
# with a backup set pointing at it over SSH, a cycle is run so the journal
# and the catalogue have real rows in them, and an administrator is
# enrolled. The SSH keypair is generated INSIDE a container and lives in a
# Docker volume that is destroyed at teardown, so the private half never
# touches this host's filesystem. The administrator's password is generated
# per run, reaches the product down a pipe into stdin, and is printed here
# because a suite that has to sign in needs it. Both are dead the moment
# this script returns.
#
# # Handing it to a suite
#
# The client container gets these, and they are the whole contract:
#
#   RM_BASE_URL          http://backupd:8080
#   RM_ADMIN_USERNAME    the enrolled administrator
#   RM_ADMIN_PASSWORD    its password, generated this run
#   RM_BACKUP_SET        the seeded set's name
#   RM_ARTIFACTS_DIR     /artifacts, mounted out to the host
#
# plus, unless --no-workflows, the workflow contract in the section
# below: the backup sets #816's scenarios need, the seeded script
# library's root, and the control channel that crashes the engine or
# takes the runner away.
#
# A Playwright config that sees RM_BASE_URL must use it as `baseURL` and
# must NOT start a web server: there is one, it is another container, and
# `npm run dev` in here would serve the mock this whole script exists to
# get away from.
#
# # Running it
#
#   scripts/e2e/three-machine-web-ui.sh
#       stand the stack up and run the built-in browser check.
#
#   scripts/e2e/three-machine-web-ui.sh --suite ../backupd-tests/suites/web-ui
#       stand it up and run that directory's Playwright suite inside the
#       client container. The suite's own node_modules is not used: the
#       image's is, because the checkout's was built for this host.
#
#   scripts/e2e/three-machine-web-ui.sh --keep-up
#       stand it up, print how to drive it, and leave it running. For
#       working on the suite without paying the setup cost per attempt.
#       Tear it down afterwards with the line it prints.
#
#   --artifacts DIR   where traces, screenshots and reports land. Outside
#                     this repository by default, and never removed by the
#                     teardown, because a failing run whose evidence was
#                     deleted with the stack is worse than no evidence.
#   --image REF       skip the build and use an already-built product image.
#   --keep-on-failure leave a failed stack up for reading.
#   --front-proxy-tls put an ordinary TLS + HTTP/2 reverse proxy in front of
#                     serve-ui, so the browser reaches the stack the way a
#                     real NAS's front door does (h2 over TLS) rather than
#                     the plain HTTP/1.1 this rig otherwise uses. The
#                     reproduction for backupd#730. RM_SEED_CYCLES=N
#                     additionally runs N backup cycles to enlarge the feed.
#   --break-engine    hand the suite the ability to take the ENGINE away
#                     mid-session, leaving serve-ui up, so the browser
#                     meets a front door that cannot reach the service
#                     behind it. The reproduction for backupd#795.
#
#                     The engine is NOT stopped up front, and that is the
#                     whole design. serve-ui proxies all of /api/v1,
#                     /auth/session included, so a stack that starts
#                     broken never gets a browser past the login page and
#                     the Activity page is never reached. The reported NAS
#                     failed the other way round: a loaded, signed-in app
#                     whose engine went away underneath it. So the break
#                     happens while the suite holds a live session.
#
#                     The client container gets two more variables:
#
#                       RM_ENGINE_UNREACHABLE=1   branch on this
#                       RM_ENGINE_CONTROL         a directory under
#                                                 /artifacts, described
#                                                 below
#
#                     and a watcher on THIS host owns the docker socket
#                     the client deliberately does not have. The protocol
#                     is files in that directory:
#
#                       write "stop"    -> the engine container is stopped
#                                          and "stopped" appears, or
#                                          "stop-failed" does
#                       write "start"   -> it is started, and "started"
#                                          appears only once its own
#                                          healthcheck passes, or
#                                          "start-failed" does
#
#                     Exactly one ack appears per request, and a success
#                     ack means the state was VERIFIED: "stopped" only
#                     after Docker reports the container not running,
#                     "started" only after `docker start` succeeded and
#                     the engine's own healthcheck passed. Anything else
#                     is a failure ack carrying a one-line reason, which
#                     the suite quotes rather than reporting its own
#                     timeout. A suite that reads a success ack as proof
#                     of the state is reading it correctly, which is why
#                     one is never written on a guess (#795).
#
#                     A request file is removed as it is picked up, so one
#                     request is never acknowledged by the leavings of the
#                     last, and "start" against an engine that is already
#                     running is a no-op that still acknowledges. A suite
#                     that deletes an ack before asking again is doing the
#                     right thing and is expected to.
#
#                     Not combinable with --keep-up: the watcher is a
#                     process of THIS script, so a kept-up stack has
#                     nobody acking. The two variables are then left off
#                     the printed command on purpose, and the manual
#                     equivalent is printed instead.
#
#                     Before handing over, the break is REHEARSED: the
#                     engine is stopped, the edge network is asked for
#                     /api/v1/activity and has to come back 502 with an
#                     X-Correlation-Id on it, and the engine is started
#                     again. A mode that cannot demonstrate the fault it
#                     exists to produce fails here rather than handing a
#                     suite a healthy stack to pass against.
#
# # The workflow machinery (#816)
#
# EPIC L put hook scripts in the product, and none of them can be proven
# in a browser against a mock: a local hook is executed by a SEPARATE
# PROCESS on the host, a remote one by an sshd that may refuse, and the
# interesting states are what a run looks like when one of those fails
# halfway. So the rig stands the whole apparatus up, and by default
# rather than behind a flag, because a workflow case that skips itself
# for want of a fixture is a case that never ran.
#
#   THE RUNNER    `backupd workflow-runner serve`, from THIS run's
#                 product image, in a container of its own
#                 (scripts/e2e/runner-machine.Dockerfile) that is NOT
#                 the engine's. It holds this host's Docker socket,
#                 because every local hook runs in an ephemeral
#                 container (#865) -- which is the privilege the
#                 installer grants the runner's service account and
#                 withholds from the engine. The engine reaches it
#                 through one authenticated Unix socket in a volume the
#                 two share, with the credential read at the path the
#                 ENGINE sees (backupd#877).
#
#   THE EXEC HOST a second sshd (scripts/e2e/exec-host.Dockerfile, the
#                 definition core/tests/machines already uses), carrying
#                 an ordinary shell account and an internal-sftp-forced
#                 one that authenticate with the SAME client key. That is
#                 what makes "this credential may not exec" provable:
#                 e2e/workflow-remote runs a NAME.remote.sh over the
#                 shell account and e2e/vps is refused one over its own
#                 transfer credential, by the server, not by this rig.
#
#   THE LIBRARY   scripts/e2e/workflows/, seeded into a volume the engine
#                 mounts read-only at /workflows. One stage directory per
#                 scenario, and every line those scripts print is
#                 asserted by the suite, which is why they are committed
#                 files rather than here-documents.
#
# The client container gets a backup set name per scenario -- happy,
# remote, SFTP-only-refused, no-hooks, before-fail, after-fail, hostile
# output, secret-backed environment, slow, crash, many-step, lint
# findings and a gate-refused script -- and the plaintext of the one
# secret a hook resolves, so a spec can assert it appears NOWHERE.
#
#   RM_WORKFLOW_CONTROL  a directory under /artifacts, the same protocol
#                        --break-engine's channel uses and for the same
#                        reason: the capability lives on THIS host and
#                        the client is given a few files rather than a
#                        Docker socket. Three requests:
#
#                          crash        -> the engine is KILLED and
#                                          started again, so a run in
#                                          flight is one nobody observed
#                                          the end of and startup
#                                          reconciliation has to account
#                                          for it. "crashed" appears
#                                          once the browser's own path to
#                                          the engine is good again, or
#                                          "crash-failed" does.
#                          runner-down  -> the runner is stopped, so a
#                                          local hook has nothing to run
#                                          on. "runner-stopped", or
#                                          "runner-down-failed".
#                          runner-up    -> and started again, acked
#                                          "runner-started" only once it
#                                          answers its own status verb,
#                                          or "runner-up-failed".
#
#                        Exactly one ack per request, a success ack means
#                        a state this script WATCHED the stack reach, and
#                        the request file is removed as it is picked up.
#                        Not handed over under --keep-up, for the reason
#                        the engine channel is not.
#
#   --no-workflows   leave all of it out. For a machine whose daemon
#                    cannot host the runner, and it is honest rather than
#                    quiet: none of the variables above is set, so every
#                    workflow case skips itself and says so.
#
# One thing this rig cannot give a browser, and says so rather than
# leaving a suite to discover it as a timeout: a browser cannot START a
# backup. POST /api/v1/operations run_backup_set is refused 403
# DESTRUCTIVE_OPERATIONS_DISABLED on every deployment this repository
# can build, because apps/common/webhost ships one DestructiveGate and
# its own doc says nothing may flip it before #92. The SCHEDULER runs
# the same cycle on a timer regardless, which gate.go states in as many
# words, so the rig sets that timer to the product's own floor -- one
# minute, config.MinPollInterval -- and hands it over as
# RM_WF_POLL_SECONDS. A spec watches for the run the timer produces
# instead of asking for one.
#
# The exit status is the client container's, not the teardown's. A run that
# tore down cleanly after a red suite is a red run.
#
# # Cost
#
# About forty seconds of setup on the machine this was written on once the

# cache because it compiles the Go binaries and the UI bundle. --image and
# --keep-up both exist to stop paying that per attempt.

# engine_watcher_loop is what the client container cannot do for itself.
# It has no Docker socket, deliberately: the thing under test is a browser
# on an edge network, and a browser that can stop containers is not one.
# So the capability is held here and exposed as a directory of files.
#
# Ordering inside each branch is the contract, not tidiness. The request
# file is removed BEFORE the work, so a second request can never be
# acknowledged by the first one's leftovers, and the ack is written AFTER
# it, so a suite that sees "started" can rely on the engine answering.
# `docker start` against a running container is a no-op that exits 0,
# which makes a redundant heal (a test that heals mid-run and again in a
# finally) acknowledge rather than fail.
#
# And an ack is only ever written for a state this watcher WATCHED the
# stack reach (#795's review, all four reviewers). Both branches used to
# `|| true` the docker command and write the success ack regardless, and
# the start branch wrote "started" even when the health loop had timed
# out. The suite across the repository boundary reads these files as
# proof: a discarded `docker stop` failure reads there as "the engine is
# unreachable" and runs the outage assertions against a healthy engine,
# and a timed-out start reads as "healthy" and runs the recovery
# assertions against an engine that never came back. Both then fail as
# product defects. So the exit status is kept, the state is read back,
# and a failure is acknowledged AS a failure: "stop-failed" /
# "start-failed", carrying a one-line reason the suite quotes. The
# contract is the same either way - exactly one file appears per request
# - which is what lets the suite stop inferring a rig fault from its own
# timeout.
