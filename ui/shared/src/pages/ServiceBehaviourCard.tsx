/**
 * Issue #845 — how often retnd looks at a source, as a control rather
 * than a config-file edit.
 *
 * # This is the card #299 deleted, built properly
 *
 * A "Service" card with a "Polling interval" picklist used to sit on this
 * page: 15/30/60 SECONDS, `defaultValue`, no handler, saving nowhere. It
 * was removed rather than wired, because the real key is a duration in
 * minutes and there was no write path for it at all. Both halves now
 * exist: the engine reads its cadence from the running configuration on
 * every wake, and this writes it.
 *
 * # Minutes here, seconds on the wire
 *
 * The API carries durations as seconds (`stale_after_seconds`,
 * `stable_for_seconds`, and now `poll_interval_seconds`), and a backup
 * cadence is a thing operators think about in minutes. This component is
 * the one place the two meet, exactly as CapacityCard is the one place a
 * byte count becomes an amount-plus-unit.
 *
 * # The floor comes from the server
 *
 * `schema.service.minPollIntervalSeconds` is what disables Save, not a
 * number written here. A local copy of a server-side bound is one that
 * eventually refuses a value the engine would accept, and the refusal an
 * operator would see for it is this form's own opinion rather than the
 * product's.
