/**
 * One backup set's Workflow panel (issue #814, screen 3).
 *
 * # The first rule: a set with no hooks shows no new noise
 *
 * Most backup sets in a real deployment configure no hooks at all, and
 * this whole wave is one edit away from putting an empty table, a
 * findings list and a run history onto every one of their pages. So the
 * panel checks first whether there is anything workflow-shaped to say —
 * this set's own stages, or the deployment's globals, which DO run
 * against it — and when there is not it says one sentence and stops.
 *
 * # Why the validation is a button and not a poll
 *
 * `GET .../workflow/validation` captures and hashes every script, opens a
 * socket to the Host Workflow Runner and an SSH connection to the source.
 * A panel that read it on mount would probe an operator's production
 * database host every time somebody opened a page, and one that polled it
 * would do so on a timer. It is read on demand, and the panel says when
 * what it is showing was read.
 *
 * # Why the exec-connection picker is a picker over a proven list
 *
 * A set's own source connection may be SFTP-only, which is a supported
 * posture and not a fault: it can move bytes and cannot execute a hook.
 * The deployment's execution connections are what the settings read
 * reports, and whether one actually works for THIS set is what validation
 * proves — so the picker offers the declared list and the findings carry
 * the verdict, rather than the picker claiming a capability nobody
 * probed.
 *
 * # Local means the Host Workflow Runner
 *
 * Every `.local.sh` row says "Local Host" and names the runner. It does
 * not run in the engine container and no copy here may imply it did: the
 * runner exists precisely because that container has no shell for a hook.

/**
 * A finding's own source, drawn the way the approved #906 design draws
 * it: a dark panel, a line-number gutter, the line in a mono face, and a
 * caret under the column the rule fired at.
 *
 * # Why a caret rather than a highlight
 *
 * A position is `line:col`, and the column is the half nobody can use
 * without counting. A caret under it is the form every compiler and every
 * shell has printed for decades; it survives being copied into a bug
 * report as text, and it needs no colour to be read — which matters here,
 * because colour is never the message on this product's surfaces. The
 * caret row carries the words "column N" beside the mark as well, so the
 * position is still stated when the alignment is what is lost: a screen
 * reader flattens the two rows into one sentence, and a row of spaces and
 * a `^` would read as nothing at all.
 *
 * # What this renders, and what it will never render
 *
 * Exactly the lines it was handed. There is no re-read of the script, no
 * request for a body, and no endpoint on this API that would answer one:
 * the excerpt arrives WITH the finding, from the bytes the verification
 * read and hashed, already inert and already bounded. So this component
 * neither sanitizes it a second time nor bounds it a second time — a
 * second copy of either would be a second thing to keep right, and the
 * one that mattered would end up being whichever nobody was looking at.
 *
 * A `truncated` line says so at its end rather than just stopping,
 * because a line that merely stops looks like a line that ends, and an
 * operator comparing this against their file would be comparing against a
 * line their file does not contain.
 *
 * An excerpt with no lines renders NOTHING — not an empty panel. A
 * finding the service carried no source for must not cost it a box of
 * dark nothing underneath.
