/**
 * The hostile output corpus (issue #815).
 *
 * Every entry is something a hook script on a source host can print, and
 * every one of them does something in a real terminal or a real browser
 * if it is passed through. It is shared by the sanitiser's own tests and
 * by the component's, so "the filter handles it" and "the rendered
 * surface is inert" are asserted against the SAME bytes — two tests that
 * each invented their own hostile string is how a class ends up covered
 * in one of them and not the other.
 *
 * Not a test file: production code never imports it, the suite does.
 * Kept here rather than under src/test/ so it sits with the filter it
 * exists to attack.
