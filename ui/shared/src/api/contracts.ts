 * that errand, so the report carries the line it is talking about and the
 * surface draws a caret under the column, which is the whole of what the
 * lookup would have produced.
 *
 * # Why this is safe to render, which a field holding somebody's script
 * has to answer before it is allowed to exist

 *     safe one. A tab arrives as a single space, deliberately, so the
 *     reported COLUMN still counts to the same place — which is what
 *     makes a caret drawable under it at all.
 *   - it is the script's own text and never a resolved value. Nothing on
 *     the path that produces it resolves an environment variable or a
 *     secret reference, so `$PGPASSWORD` in a hook reaches this field as
 *     the eleven characters somebody typed. That is the point rather than
 *     a limitation: the finding is about the text, and this product has
 *     no read anywhere that carries a resolved secret.
 *   - it comes from the bytes that were HASHED, not from a later re-read.
 *     An excerpt fetched afterwards could disagree with the position
 *     beside it — somebody edits the hook between the check and the
 *     render — and a caret under the wrong line is worse than no caret.
 *
 * An excerpt with no lines is the ordinary absent case, not an error: an
