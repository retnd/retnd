// Records the moving pictures on docs/site/workflows.html.
//
// Run it from the repository root:
//
//     node docs/site/tools/capture-workflows.mjs
//
// It writes GIFs into docs/site/screens/ and prints one line per clip
// with its frame count, duration and size, so a diff of the output tells
// you which picture moved and what it cost.
//
// harness.mjs holds the arrangement: where the app comes from, why it is
// never a real deployment, why the clock, the locale, the timezone and
// the port are pinned, and why a clip is a list of held frames rather
// than a video. Read that first.
//
// # What is on this page and what is not
//
// Ten clips, and every one of them is a claim EPIC L (#807) makes that a
// still cannot carry. The run screen and the two configuration cards are
// #814; the per-step terminal is #815; this page and these recordings
// are #817.
//
//   wf-run-timeline     Five stages, always five, always in the order a
//                       run executes them. The claim is about the ones
//                       with nothing in them: a stage that planned no
//                       scripts and a stage with no directory at all are
//                       drawn, named and told apart, because "did not
//                       run" and "not configured" are different facts
//                       and a ladder that hid either would read as the
//                       hooks having been skipped.
//   wf-step-terminal    One terminal, belonging to the selection, read
//                       by cursor and read-only. It ends on the step
//                       whose output the ENGINE truncated, because that
//                       marker is a statement about the log rather than
//                       a line the script printed, and the two must not
//                       look alike.
//   wf-before-failure   A before hook failed, so the backup was never
//                       attempted: backup_status is SKIPPED and not
//                       failed. A product that wrote "failed" there
//                       would be reporting a transfer that never
//                       started.
//   wf-status-split     The three verdicts are three, and none of them
//                       is derived from the others. Four runs in one
//                       clip, because one run can only ever show one
//                       triple and the claim is about the combinations.
//   wf-recovery         recovery_required, with both ways out in shot
//                       and no third one. There is no dismiss on this
//                       banner and nothing in this clip closes it: the
//                       only exits are resuming the cleanup and taking
//                       responsibility for it in writing.
//   wf-set-workflow-tab One backup set's discovered scripts, checked on
//                       demand. The check hashes every script and parses
//                       its shell in this process; nothing in a script
//                       is executed to produce a finding, and BSH003 is
//                       the only rule today whose severity refuses a
//                       save.
//   wf-env-table        Precedence, and a secret that is a LOCATION. The
//                       whole BACKUPD_ prefix is refused in
//                       configuration rather than silently overridden at
//                       merge time, which is why the clip types one in.
//   wf-settings-runner  The deployment-wide card, ending on the row that
//                       says what this read does NOT know. Nothing on
//                       that card contacts the Host Workflow Runner, so
//                       it reports a CONFIGURED address and never a live
//                       one.
//   wf-dark-mode        A whole window at once, which is the only way to
//                       see a theme, driven by the application's own
//                       toggle.
//   wf-narrow           The same run at 480px, where the verdict triple
//                       stacks. It is the one layout claim on the page.
//
// # No resolved secret is ever in frame
//
// PGPASSWORD is in three of these clips and its value is in none of
// them, because there is no value to be in them: the fixture holds a
// reference (`from_secret.file`) and no read on this API carries what it
// resolves to. The cell says where the value comes from and "never
// shown", and there is no control anywhere on the card that offers to
// reveal one.
//
// # Why most of these are whole-window, and what the other three crop to
//
// A crop that names a selector anchors on that region in document
// coordinates, which is what lets it survive a scroll. It cannot survive
// a NAVIGATION: the anchor is measured on the first frame, and the same
// region on the next run sits at a different offset because that run has
// a different number of banners above it. Nor can it survive a scroll
// when the region is taller than the window, because then the anchor IS
// the window. Seven of these clips move between runs, or scroll a card
// several times taller than the viewport, so they photograph the window.
//
// The three that are of one card in a two-column page crop instead to an
// explicit rectangle — the card's own column, measured off the card at
// capture time and fixed to the window rather than to the document, so a
// scroll moves the page behind a crop that stays put. That is worth the
// extra line because those three are tables, and a table that spends
// half its pixels on the empty column beside it is a table nobody reads.
// Nothing is staged either way; it is the page as the application drew
// it.
