// Records the moving pictures on docs/site/ssh.html.
//
// Run it from the repository root:
//
//     node docs/site/tools/capture-ssh.mjs
//
// harness.mjs holds the arrangement: where the app comes from, why it is
// never a real deployment, why the clock and timezone are pinned, and why
// a clip is a list of held frames rather than a video.
//
// # The two clips, and what they are each about
//
// #592 replaced two write-only text boxes with a wizard. The boxes asked
// an operator to paste "the id of an imported key", and a key id is a
// uuid the product showed exactly once, in the response to the import
// that created it. The wizard's first step is the answer to that: it
// lists what this deployment already holds and what it can find on the
// machine, and on a default install the key the installer generated is
// already sitting there waiting to be picked.
//
// #624 is the other half. Trusting a host key settles which machine
// answered and settles nothing about whether the key authenticates or
// whether the account can read the folder, so a wizard that stopped at
// the host key was letting a set be saved on a connection nobody had
// proven. The second clip is the check that closes that, on the step
// where it now blocks the save.
//
// That step is no longer Review. #788 rebuilt the add-backup-set rail
// into eight steps and folded the credentials, the host key and this
// check into one "Connection test" step, second in the flow, because its
// answer constrains the steps after it — the write probe in the same
// report is what decides whether step 7 may offer to delete from the
// source at all. So the second clip is recorded on step 2, where the
// panel lives and where the gate bites, rather than on step 8. The three
// save buttons it used to show in the same frame are six steps away now;
// what stands in for them is the panel's own sentence, which goes from
// "Nothing has been proven yet" to "This source has been proven. Saving
// is enabled." The first clip is unaffected: the SSH authentication
// dialog is its own four-step wizard (components/SSHAuthWizard.tsx) and
// #788 did not touch it, which is why its "Next: …" buttons below are
// still the shipped names.
//
// # No key material is ever in frame
//
// The paste box is photographed empty and the candidate that gets picked
// is one the fixture puts on the machine, selected by its path. Selecting
// a candidate imports it server side, so key material never crosses the
// network at all, and there is none here to cross it.
