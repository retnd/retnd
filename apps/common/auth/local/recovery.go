// Account recovery: the four routes and the three messages issue #830
// adds, and the two rules that shape all of them.
//
// The first rule is that forgot-password must not be an account oracle.
// POST /forgot-password answers 204 to everything - an unenrolled
// deployment, a username that is not the administrator's, an
// administrator with no recovery address, an SMTP endpoint that refuses
// the message - because every distinguishable answer tells an
// unauthenticated caller something about the account. That extends to the
// CLOCK, which is why the send happens on a goroutine rather than inline:
// a matching username that triggers a real SMTP round trip would
// otherwise take a second or two while a non-matching one returned
// instantly, and a timing difference that large is an oracle as usable as
// a different status code. The response is written before any mail is
// attempted, always.
//
// The second is that the SMTP password is never readable. It arrives on
// the enrollment or settings request, goes straight into a 0600 file of
// its own (secrets.go), and what is persisted and returned afterwards is
// a reference and a boolean. GET /recovery has structurally no field for
// it: smtpSettingsView carries PasswordSet, not a password, so there is
// no code path - not even a buggy one - that could serialise the material
// onto a response.
//
// The remaining routes (PATCH /recovery, POST /recovery/test) are
// authenticated and the operator is waiting on them, so those DO report
// the SMTP error: the whole point of a test send is to find out what is
// wrong with the configuration you just typed.

// The three subjects this package sends. Fixed strings rather than
// operator-configurable ones: they are the only mail this product sends,
// and an operator filtering them in their client needs them stable.
//
// The confirmation subject this file used to declare is gone: since #830
// §8 the message a new (or newly changed) recovery address receives IS
// the verification link, and its subject lives with the rest of that
// flow in verify.go (verifySubject).

// smtpSettingsRequest is the SMTP half of an enrollment or a settings
// update. It mirrors api/v1/openapi.json's SmtpSettings, and
// ui/shared/src/api/client.ts's own `smtp` object, field for field.
//
// Password is write-only in both directions of that mirror: the contract
// marks it writeOnly, no response schema in this package contains it, and
// an empty value on an UPDATE means "keep the one already stored" rather
// than "set an empty password" - which is what lets an operator change

// repoint them at infrastructure of their own, press forgot-password,
// receive the link, reset the password and sign the real operator out
// for good. A stolen cookie is a temporary problem; a stolen cookie
// that can rewrite the recovery path is a permanent one. The password
// check therefore runs FIRST, before the SMTP password is resolved or
// stored, before any message is sent and before anything is written -
// a refused request must not have touched the secret vault, and must
// not have made this process connect to a caller-named mail server.
//
// The order matters twice more. Everything is validated before anything
// is written, so a refused request changes nothing. And when the
// recovery address OR the SMTP endpoint changes, a message is sent over

// on failure, the whole update is refused - an operator must not be

// received anything, nor with an endpoint nothing has ever been
// delivered through, which are the two shapes of the silent lockout
// #830 exists to prevent. An SMTP-only change on an already-verified
// address sends the test message rather than a verification link: the
// mailbox has already proved somebody reads it, and what is unproven is
// the new endpoint's ability to reach it.
//
// A changed address also drops the VERIFIED flag (#830 §8): the proof
// that somebody can read a mailbox belongs to the address it was earned
// for, and carrying it across a change would report the new one as
