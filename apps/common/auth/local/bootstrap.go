// The single-use secrets this package hands out: the one that stands
// between an unclaimed deployment and whoever reaches its port first, and
// the one that stands between a forgotten password and a new one.
//
// §49.1's requirement for the first is easy to state and easy to get
// subtly wrong: reaching the port must not be enough to claim the
// administrator account. The token this file issues is what makes the
// difference, and its three properties all exist because of a specific
// way the naive version leaks. It is held in memory only, so a restart
// before enrollment completes invalidates whatever a previous run printed
// rather than leaving a standing credential in a file somebody might
// later read. There is only ever one live at a time, so a second start
// cannot leave two valid claims. And consume marks it used inside the
// same lock that checks it, so two requests arriving together cannot both
// win.
//
// The bootstrap token is printed to the process's own stdout and nowhere
// else. That is not a limitation to work around later: any channel that
// could deliver it elsewhere would be a channel an attacker could try to
// reach.
//
// The password-reset token (#830) is the same mechanism with a different
// delivery channel and a different TTL, which is why it is the same type
// rather than a second copy of it. It is delivered by email to the
// administrator's confirmed recovery address, and it is held in memory
// for the same reason: a restart invalidating an outstanding reset link
// is the correct behaviour for a credential that was mailed out, and a
// persisted one would be a standing password-reset credential sitting in
// the state directory.

// bootstrapTokenTTL bounds how long a printed enrollment token remains
// valid (§49.1: "SHALL be single-use and SHALL expire"). 30 minutes is
// long enough for an operator to read the container's own startup log
// and paste the token into the enrollment page, short enough that a
// token nobody used stops being a standing credential.
const bootstrapTokenTTL = 30 * time.Minute

// resetTokenTTL bounds how long an emailed password-reset link remains
// valid. The same 30 minutes as the bootstrap token, for the same reason
// and deliberately not longer: the operator who asked for the link is
// sitting in front of their mail client, and a link that stays live for
// hours is a password-reset credential lying in an inbox.
