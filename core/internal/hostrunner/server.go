// The server: one socket, two locks on it, and a lease that outlives
// nothing.
//
// # Unix domain only
//
// There is no address field, no --listen flag, no TCP fallback and no
// code path in this package that calls net.Listen with anything but
// "unix". That is a decision rather than a default: a TCP listener would
// make the runner reachable from the network the moment somebody set it
// to 0.0.0.0 while debugging, and what is on the other end of this socket
// is arbitrary code execution as the service account. A socket also gives
// the kernel a say -- directory and file permissions -- which a port
// never can.
//
// # Two independent locks
//
// The socket is 0600 in a 0700 directory. And every connection must
// present the installation's credential. See the package doc for why one
// of those is not enough on the deployments this product ships to.
//
// # The lease
//
// A connection that is running a step owns that step. When the read side
// of that connection fails -- the engine crashed, its container was
// recreated, the machine it was on lost power -- the step's context is
// cancelled with errLeaseExpired, and Executor.Execute terminates the
// process group and removes the working directory.
//
// The alternative is not "the hook finishes on its own". It is a hook
// that has quiesced a database, an engine that is no longer there to run
// the matching `after` hook, and nothing anywhere that will ever notice.
// A lease is the only structure that turns an engine crash into a bounded
// event.

// ErrServer is a refusal about serving itself: running as root, a socket
// another runner already holds, a credential file that is not private.
var ErrServer = errors.New("hostrunner: this workflow runner cannot serve")

// ErrRunningAsRoot is the refusal that cannot be configured away.
//
// #809 states it as a requirement and the reasoning is worth restating
// where the check is: an operator installed this product as an
// administrator, which says nothing whatever about whether they meant
// every hook script in a directory to run as root. A runner that executed
// as root by default would turn "drop a file in /workflows" into "drop a
// file in /workflows and own the machine", and would do it for a file
// that arrived by rsync from somewhere else.
//
// There is deliberately NO override flag. An operator who genuinely needs
// a privileged action in a hook has a tool for it that is auditable,
// per-command, and already installed: sudoers. A flag here would be a
// single switch that silently re-privileges every hook at once, and every
// deployment that ever flips it stays flipped.
