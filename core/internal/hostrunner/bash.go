// Preflight: fixing the interpreter ONCE, at startup, and reporting it.
//
// A runner that resolved `bash` through PATH at each execution would be a
// runner whose interpreter can change between two steps of the same run:
// PATH is part of the hook environment, which is operator-configurable per
// backup set, so a set that sets PATH=/opt/busybox/bin would silently run
// its hooks under a different shell from the deployment's other sets. That
// is not a hypothetical on the NAS platforms this product targets, where
// /bin/sh is ash and a second bash arrives with every package manager.
//
// So: resolved once, at serve time, recorded as an absolute path,
// reported by `status`, and used verbatim for every exec afterwards --
// including the `bash -n` preflight, so the shell that judges a script's
// syntax is the shell that will run it.
//
// The absence of bash is a first-class answer rather than an error at
// execution time. #809's acceptance criteria require `.local.sh`
// validation to fail BEFORE a backup starts when bash is missing, and a
// runner that only discovers it at exec time cannot make that true.

// ErrBash is every refusal about the interpreter: not found, not a
// regular file, not executable, or unwilling to report a version.
var ErrBash = errors.New("hostrunner: this host has no usable bash for workflow hooks")

// BashCandidates are the paths searched, in order, when no interpreter is
// configured.
//
// PATH is deliberately not consulted: see this file's preamble. The list
// is the three places bash actually lives on the platforms this product
// supports -- /bin/bash on Linux and in the Debian-family NAS packages,
// /usr/bin/bash on the distributions that merged /bin, and
// /usr/local/bin/bash where a BSD-ish or macOS host got it from a package
// manager. An operator whose bash is somewhere else configures the path,
// which is a fact worth stating in their configuration anyway.
