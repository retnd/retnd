// This file is the verification ladder: one walk, four depths, and a
// report of what was actually done rather than of what was asked for.
//
// # Why the rungs are one code path and not four
//
// Because they have to be comparable. Every rung resolves the same tree
// through the same walker and differs only in how far it goes into each
// entry, so "the sampled run passed and the full run failed" is a
// statement about depth rather than about two implementations that happen
// to disagree. Four separate verifiers would each have their own idea of
// what an object is, and the ladder's whole value is that a higher rung
// includes everything a lower one checked.
//
// # Why this is not the vendor's Verifier
//
// snapshotfs.Verifier is close, and it was what this adapter used while
// there was only one depth to offer. Two of its decisions are wrong for a
// ladder whose rungs get WRITTEN DOWN as a claim:
//
//   - its sampling is a coin flip per file (100*rand.Float64() <
//     VerifyFilesPercent), so two runs of the same configuration read
//     different amounts, and on a small tree a sampled run reads nothing
//     at all while the catalog records content_sample. A COUNT -- exactly
//     ceil(files*percent/100) of the files the walk finds -- reads the
//     stated fraction, and its report means what it says.
//   - it offers no way to separate "the structure resolves" from "the
//     bytes are there", which is exactly the distinction between the
//     first two rungs.
//
// What is kept is the part that is genuinely hard and genuinely theirs:
// snapshotfs.TreeWalker, which walks a snapshot tree in parallel,
// deduplicates repeated objects and bounds the error budget.

// verifyErrorBudget caps how many per-object findings one verification
// collects before it stops walking.
//
// The walker treats this as "abort after N errors", and its default is 1,
// which turns a verification report into "the first thing that is wrong".
// For a tool whose operator question is "how bad is it", the first error
// is the least useful possible answer, so this is deliberately high enough
// to describe real damage and still bounded, because a repository that is
// wrong in ten thousand places does not need the ten thousand and first
// finding to justify a restore from elsewhere.
const verifyErrorBudget = 1000

// Verify implements backupengine.Repository.
//
// The error and the report are independent, which is VerifyReport's own
// contract: a walk torn down by a cancelled context and a walk that found
// damage both come back with partial stats and a non-nil error, and only
// the first of them means nothing was learned. ctx.Err() therefore takes
// precedence over everything else.
//
// A failed verification reports NO achieved level. The field is what was
// proven, and a verification that did not pass proved nothing -- the
// caller writes that empty value into the catalog row, so a set whose
// last run failed cannot be read as still holding the level of the run
// before it.
