// One report per script, in the one shape every surface renders: the
// parse verdict, and the findings this product's own rules produced.
//
// # Why the parse verdict and the findings are separate fields
//
// Because they fail differently and a caller has to be able to act on
// that. A parse error means there is no program: nothing after it was
// analysed and the script cannot run at all. A finding means the program
// is well-formed and something in it is wrong -- sometimes fatally (an
// `rm -rf` that becomes `rm -rf /` the day a variable is unset), usually
// not (a `cd` whose failure nothing checks). Folding both into one list
// of "problems" would make the save gate's threshold unexpressible, and
// the threshold is the feature.
//
// # Why there is no error return
//
// The only way this can decline to answer is a script larger than
// MaxScriptBytes, which is a fact about the script rather than a fault of
// the caller, and one an operator has to be able to read. An error return
// would have callers choosing between discarding the answer they did get
// and inventing prose for a failure they cannot interpret.

// The severities a finding can carry.
//
// Four, and they are the four an operator already reads on this
// product's other validation surface, meaning the same things: `error` is
// a refusal, the rest are reports. Only `error` blocks a save
// (ScriptReport.Blocks), and which rule carries which severity is argued
// at the rule.

// MaxScriptBytes is the largest script this package will look at.
//
// It is workflow.DefaultMaxScriptSize's value and not a coincidence: that
// is how large a hook script may be by default, so the ordinary
// deployment is never told its script was too large to check.
//
// What it does NOT do is make the parser safe, and this comment used to
// claim that it did. A megabyte of "$(" is a legal script at the default
// size limit and it drives mvdan.cc/sh's recursive descent off the
// goroutine stack, which in Go is a FATAL error that no deferred
// recover() can catch: the process dies, and this code path is reachable
// from a configuration write and from an API read. The bound that makes
// the parser safe is MaxNestingDepth, checked by a linear pre-scan
// before the parser is handed anything; this one bounds the WORK.
//
// A deployment that raises workflows.max_script_size_bytes past this gets
// "not examined" for the scripts above it, which says what happened. It
// does not get a pass, and it does not get a refused save: refusing to
// save a legitimately-configured deployment because this package declined
// to look would be a gate on the wrong thing.
