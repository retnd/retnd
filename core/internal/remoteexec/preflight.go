// The five things it establishes are #810's own list, and each of them is
// something that cannot be assumed:
//
//   - the host identity matches the pinned policy. That is settled before
//     this function is reached, by Dial, and is recorded here because an
//     audit line that says which host a hook ran on is only worth reading
//     if the identity was checked.
//   - the exec channel is permitted. An internal-sftp-forced account
//     refuses it; a forced-command account accepts it and runs something
//     else. Both are caught by requiring the probe's own marker.
//   - bash is present and executable at the configured path. A missing
//     path is the login shell's 127, a non-executable one its 126, and
//     both are reported as capability refusals naming the path rather than
//     as hook failures.
//   - the invocation works with no PTY. Asserted from inside the probe,
//     because "we did not request one" is a statement about this client
//     and not about what the session got.
//   - the captured bytes parse on the TARGET, with the target's own bash.
//     A script written for bash 5 can fail to parse on bash 3.2, and the
//     honest place to discover that is before the hook has half run.
//
// What comes back is the Capability Run requires. A refusal is
// ErrExecCapability, which the caller turns into a failed remote-hook
// validation. Artifact backup over the same credential is untouched:
// nothing here changes the transfer path.
