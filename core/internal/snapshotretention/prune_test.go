// What this file is for: proving that the snapshot half of retention is
// the SAME retention, and that the two things which must survive it do.
//
// Every claim here is one of issue #785's acceptance criteria, and each
// one is written against the real journal rather than a fake catalog. The
// reason is the §39 case below: "a failed newer backup must not evict the
// last-known-good" is half a policy decision and half a durable rule about
// a column, and a test that stubbed the catalog would only ever prove the
// half this package owns.
//
// The repository, by contrast, IS a fake here, and deliberately so: what a
// unit test needs from it is a record of exactly which manifests were
// asked for and which were removed. The real engine is exercised in
// kopiablobs_test.go, which asks the question this fake cannot -- what
// happened to the repository's own storage.
