// The durable transitions the five-stage workflow lifecycle runs on
// (EPIC L, #811), and the one discipline they all share.
//
// # Every write asks the domain whether it is legal first
//
// internal/workflow owns the two transition graphs (State.CanFollowForRun
// and CanFollowForStep) and the obligation's (ObligationState.CanFollow).
// This file reads the CURRENT value out of the row, asks the graph, and
// refuses anything it does not allow -- inside the same transaction as
// the write, so the check and the write cannot be separated by another
// connection.
//
// That is not defensive decoration, it is the whole reason a crash is
// tractable. "A crash between any two durable transitions reconciles
// deterministically" is a claim about a FINITE set of positions, and it
// only holds if no write could have put a row somewhere the graph does
// not admit. A journal that accepted any state for any row would make
// the reconciliation a guess about which of the writes had happened.
//
// # There is no write here that clears an outstanding recovery
//
// AdvanceWorkflowRun refuses to lower a run's recovery state, and that is
// the structural half of #811's requirement that --skip-workflow-scripts
// (L6) cannot clear recovery_required. A flag that skips hooks reaches
// this journal through the ordinary advance, and the ordinary advance
// cannot say "and consider the interruption dealt with". The two calls
// that can are ResolveWorkflowRecovery, which requires every obligation
// to have reached a settled state first, and the acknowledgement path,
// which requires an actor and a reason it writes down.
//
// # Times are the caller's, not this layer's
//
// Every transition takes the moment as a parameter. The engine's clock is
// injectable so that the crash-injection tests are deterministic, and a
// journal that stamped rows with time.Now() would make half of each
// record untestable and the other half disagree with the step's own
// timestamps by whatever the write cost.

// ErrWorkflowObligationNotFound is returned when a run has no obligation
// for the scope named. It is a value for ErrWorkflowRunNotFound's reason:
// no caller needs structure out of it.
