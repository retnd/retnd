// The workflow plan's durable side (EPIC L, #808): one run row per backup
// cycle that had hooks, one step row per script that cycle decided to run.
//
// This package STORES the vocabulary as plain strings and does not invent
// it: state, scope, phase, target and the three statuses are columns of
// text, for the reason types.go states about the FR-10 lifecycle
// vocabulary -- the vocabulary belongs to internal/workflow, and a second
// opinion about it in a lower layer is how two vocabularies drift apart.
//
// It does not follow that the write path may take the vocabulary on trust,
// and the first version of this file made exactly that mistake: it
// accepted a plan of plain strings and checked only that they were
// non-empty. "state" of "whatever", a step whose target said local and
// whose script name said remote, a timeout of zero -- all committed, all
// read back by a recovery pass after a restart, and a recovery pass has no
// second chance to notice. So CommitWorkflowPlan takes the DOMAIN types
// and calls their own Validate before the transaction opens: the
// vocabulary is still internal/workflow's, and this journal refuses to
// store anything that package would not have produced.
//
// What this file adds on top is STRUCTURE -- the fields without which a
// row is silently useless, and the atomicity of a plan -- and
// 0012_workflow_runs.sql carries the argument for the shape.
//
// The one rule worth reading before changing anything here: a plan is
// committed in ONE transaction, run row and step rows together. "Durably
// committed before any hook may execute" is a claim about all of it, and a
// crash between the run and its steps would leave a run row pointing at a
// script spool with no steps in it -- which a recovery pass reads as "this
// run had nothing to do", while the spool on disk says otherwise.

// workflowScriptsDirName is the subdirectory of a run's spool that holds
// the captured scripts. internal/workflow creates it; this is the copy the
// cross-check below compares against, and the two are pinned together by
// TestTheSpoolLayoutThisJournalChecksIsTheOneWorkflowCreates.

	// They are committed in the same transaction as the run and its
