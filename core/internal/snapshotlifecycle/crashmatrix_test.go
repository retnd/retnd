// This file is the part of #784's verification matrix that a per-boundary
// test cannot be: the proof that the list of boundaries is COMPLETE, and
// that the two things a recovery pass must never do it never does at ANY
// of them.
//
// reconcile_test.go already has one test per crash boundary #783 names,
// and each of those describes its own boundary better than anything here
// could. What that file cannot say is "and there are no others". A phase
// added to the table in phases.go, or a verdict added to the closed set
// in reconcile.go, would leave every test in it passing while a crashed
// row sat undecided for ever -- and an undecided row is an invisible one,
// which is the failure mode reconcile.go's own header is written against.
//
// So the tests below take the phase table and VerdictKinds() as their
// INPUT rather than restating them: they enumerate the vocabulary, drive
// every state in it, and fail when the vocabulary grows without a rule to
// go with it. The route to each phase is derived from the table too, by
// crashPath, so a nominal path that gains a phase is walked rather than
// skipped.
//
// Rows are seeded through reconcile_test.go's seed(), which walks the same
// legal edges a live run walks, because a row placed at a phase by any
// other means would be a state no crash can actually produce.

// The identities the matrix seeds. Two rows are enough for every property
// here: the one a process died in, and an older successful one holding the
// restore point that must survive whatever happens to the newer.
