// `backupd validate workflow <source/backup-set>`: everything this
// product can find out about a set's hooks WITHOUT running one (#813).
//
// # The rule that shapes the whole file
//
// Validation never executes a script body. Not once, not "just the safe
// ones", not behind a flag. A hook is arbitrary code an operator wrote to
// quiesce a database, and a validation that ran it would be a command
// somebody types to check their configuration that stops a production
// database. So the only two things that ever reach an interpreter here
// are `bash -n` -- parse, never execute -- and the remote capability
// PROBE, which is internal/remoteexec's own fixed script and not the
// operator's.
//
// # Why the bulk of it is one call to Snapshot
//
// Because Snapshot is what a real run does, and validating through a
// second implementation would validate the second implementation. It
// resolves each stage directory inside the approved root, refuses a
// symlink or a group-writable ancestor at every level, parses every
// script name into a target, orders the plan bytewise, captures the bytes
// and records their sha256. Those are six of #813's items and they are
// exactly the six a run would refuse on. Re-deriving them here would
// produce a validation that can pass while the run fails, which is worse
// than no validation.
//
// What it costs is a spool, because capturing is what hashing means. So
// validation spools to a directory of its own and removes it: a real run
// keeps its spool because a recovery has to be able to re-execute the
// exact bytes, and a validation has nothing to recover.
//
// # Why a set can be valid for backup and invalid for workflows
//
// #813 requires this to be sayable and it is the normal case during
// setup: a backup set whose source connects, whose destination is
// writable and whose retention is sound, with a hook directory somebody
// has not created yet. Reporting the set as broken would tell an operator
// their backups are failing when they are not. So there are two verdicts
// and the report carries both.

// The check ids this validation reports, one per item #813 enumerates.
//
// A closed vocabulary rather than free text, because these reach a JSON
// surface and a UI: a client that groups by check, or an operator who
// greps for one, needs the id to be a value rather than a sentence. The
// SENTENCE is Detail, and it is free to be rewritten; the id is not.
