// `workflow`: reading a hook run back, and dealing with one this product
// could not finish (EPIC L, #813).
//
// It is the inspection half of the workflow surface. The CONFIGURATION
// half lives under the nouns it belongs to -- `settings workflow` for the
// deployment-wide block, `backup-set workflow` for one set's, `validate
// workflow` for the report on both -- because an operator looking for
// "where do I set the hook timeout" looks under settings, not under a
// third noun that happens to share a word. What is here is everything
// that is about a RUN: what happened, what one step printed, and what is
// still owed.
//
// # Why the run reads answer from this host's journal
//
// Because that is where a workflow run IS. #813's three statuses, every
// step, every captured byte and the recovery axis are durable rows
// (internal/state's workflow tables), written by whichever process
// executed the run and readable by anything that can open the journal.
// So `workflow run list` beside a serving engine reads the same rows that
// engine wrote, rather than needing a route to it, which is the same
// position `activity` without --follow is in and for the same reason.
//
// One read is genuinely different and says so: `workflow recovery show`.
// See workflowRecoveryShow's own doc, which is the longest thing in this
// file, because the honest answer there cost an argument.
//
// # Why the two actions are not configuration writes
//
// `resume-cleanup` and `acknowledge` change the journal and never
// config.yaml, so they come through openBackupService with readsConfig,
// exactly as `restore` does (mode.go's own doc names restore as the
// precedent: "declared readsConfig and writes an operation row, which is
// true of the configuration and not of the deployment"). Neither is
// refused beside a serving engine, and neither may be: a run that left a
// machine quiesced is at its most dangerous precisely when the engine
// that abandoned it has been restarted and is serving again.
//
// What keeps two processes from unwinding one run at once is the journal
// rather than anything here. workflowrun's obligation state machine moves
// a scope to in_progress durably before it executes a hook, and refuses a
// second caller that finds it there, so a resume typed at a terminal and
// a resume clicked in a browser serialise on a row rather than racing.

// workflowNouns is the two things `workflow` has verbs about.
//
// A table rather than a switch, for workflowRunnerVerbs' reason:
// TestUsage_EveryRegisteredCommandIsPinned reads main.go's map, which has
// one entry for `workflow` and cannot see a level below it, so a verb
// added here with no line in usage() would be dispatchable,
// undiscoverable and pinned by nothing. TestUsage_NamesEveryWorkflowVerb
// holds every leaf of this tree against usage().
//
// Two levels, because `workflow run log` is three words and the middle
// one is a noun rather than a verb. Flattening it to `workflow run-log`
// would read as a fourth thing an operator has to learn instead of as the
// log of the run they were just looking at.

// workflowRecoveryShow is `workflow recovery show`: every run that is

//
// # Why this does not call WorkflowRecovery
//
// It is the obvious call and it would be wrong here, which is worth
// spelling out at length because the next person to read this file will
// reach for it.
//
// service.WorkflowRecovery returns the ENGINE's own in-memory refusal
// set: the map workflowrun.Engine builds during its startup
// reconciliation and moves only through writes made in that same process
// (internal/workflowrun/recovery.go says so in as many words: "why the
// refusal is in memory and the truth is on disk"). A serving engine's
// answer is therefore exact and free. This binary's answer would be
// EMPTY, always, because the BackupService a CLI verb opens builds a
// fresh engine that has reconciled nothing -- so `workflow recovery show`
// would print "nothing outstanding" at an operator whose source machine
// is sitting quiesced. That is the single worst output this command could
// produce, and it would be produced by the API call whose name says it is
// the right one.
//
// The fix that suggests itself is worse. Calling ReconcileWorkflows here
// would populate that map, and a reconciliation pass from a CLI process
// would also mark a SERVING engine's in-flight run as interrupted: the
// "is this set locked" guard that protects a live run is an in-memory
// lock table belonging to the process executing it (Engine.setIsLocked),
// so a second process cannot see it and reconciles straight over the top.
// The result would be a `show` that blocks a backup set underneath a
// backup that is still running. A read verb that writes is bad enough; a
// read verb that can block the deployment it was asked about is not
// shippable.
//
// So this reads the DURABLE truth, which is what the reconciliation reads
// too: the run rows themselves. A run whose recovery state is unsettled
// is owed a cleanup or a person; a run still in a non-terminal state is
// either executing right now or was abandoned by a process that is gone,
// and the journal alone cannot tell those two apart -- so both are
// reported, under headings that say which is which, rather than one of
// them being guessed at.
//
// What this cannot report, and the reason it is not a gap worth closing
// here: the per-SCOPE breakdown and the spool path
// (service.WorkflowRecoveryHold's Scope and SpoolRef). Those come off the
// hold, which is the engine's, and the surface that has them is the
// serving process's own -- its API and the browser reading it. An
// operator here gets the run, the set, how long it has been like that and
// the two actions, which is everything needed to act; whoever wants to
// read the hooks a resume would execute has the run id to ask that
// process with.
//
// # Why oldest first
//
// Every other run read in this file is newest first, because the question
// is "what just happened". This one's question is "how long has a machine
// been left like this", and the answer an operator has to act on first is
