// `validate workflow <source/backup-set>`: everything this product can
// find out about a backup set's hooks without running one (EPIC L, #813).
//
// # Why it is a form of `validate` rather than a verb of `workflow`
//
// Because it answers the question `validate` already answers, about a
// different subject. An operator who has typed `backupd validate
// <artifact>` to ask "is this still sound" asks "are my hooks sound" the
// same way, and a second noun would mean learning that this product calls
// one of those checking and the other one something else. cmdValidate
// therefore takes `workflow` as its first operand, the way `settings`
// takes `patch`.
//
// # The exit code is the verdict, and there are two verdicts
//
// Exit 0 when the hooks are sound, 1 when they are not, so this is usable
// in the monitoring shape `check` and `repository health` already are.
// What it must not do is fold the SET's own soundness into that: a backup
// set whose source connects, whose destination is writable and whose
// retention is sound, with a hook directory somebody has not created yet,
// is a set whose backups are fine and whose hooks are broken. #813
// requires that combination to be visibly sayable and
// core/service.WorkflowValidation carries both answers for it, so this
// prints a line of its own the moment they disagree. Reporting "this
// backup set is broken" there would tell an operator their backups are
// failing when they are not.
//
// # Nothing here executes a hook
//
// Not once, not behind a flag. core/service's ValidateWorkflow is where
// that rule lives and it is worth restating at the surface an operator
// types: a hook is arbitrary code somebody wrote to quiesce a database,
// and a validation that ran it would be a command you type to check your
// configuration that stops production. The only two things that reach an
// interpreter are `bash -n`, which parses and never executes, and this
// product's own fixed capability probe.

// validateWorkflowOperand is the word that turns `validate` into this
// command.
//
// A const rather than a literal because cmdValidate has to match on it
// BEFORE it parses an artifact id, and the two live in different files:
// a rename that reached only one of them would leave `validate workflow
// a/b` being refused by app.ParseArtifactID with a sentence about
// artifact ids, which is a refusal about the wrong thing and the exact
// mistake this operand exists to avoid.
